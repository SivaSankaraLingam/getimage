Image Resizer Backend + Frontend

**Overview**

Image Resizer is a simple web-based application that allows users to upload an image, send it to a backend server, and receive a resized version in return. 
The backend handles image processing, while the frontend offers a clean interface for users to upload and view images.

**Project Structure**
Frontend (index.html, script.js): A lightweight HTML/JS interface for file upload and display.

Backend (/api/getImages): An API endpoint that accepts uploaded images, resizes them using server-side logic, and responds with the resized image.

**Features**
1) Upload any image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
2) Automatically sends the image to the backend for resizing
3) Displays the resized image on the page
